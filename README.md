To use the bot, create a file called "key.txt" which contains the bot key, and a file called "servers.txt" which contains all servers the bot will be used on seperated by a newline and run rob_ot.py

If you want to fork(or want me to think about adding specific features), let me know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the bot
