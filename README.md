To use the bot, create a file called "key.txt" which contains the bot key, and a file called "servers.txt" which contains all servers the bot will be used on seperated by a newline and run rob_ot.py, this should automatically create servers.json and reminders.json

Currently some of the features crash out when given invalid keys, the bot still works, but I'll be trying to fix these once I have time 

If you want to use the bot and don't want the verify feature, just comment out the line add_verify(bot, servers)
in rob_ot.py

If you want to fork(or want me to think about adding specific features), let me know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the bot
